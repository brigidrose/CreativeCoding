Ok, so it doesn't look pretty with all the extra commented out code, but the reason I left it is because I wanted to show
the different things I tried in order to get things working. 

-The confetti part of the code was pulled from open processing
//Sketch done by Federica Bozzola @ this  url...
//http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/163031

-The rest of the code was done by me though there are a few commented out bits of code that I pulled from various
sources but didn't wind up using.

-Issue I had-

-I really wanted to get the confetti to follow my mouse on press and have it kind of cascade down like a waterfall of cool
looking triangles, but I could only get it to show one triangle at a time.

-It took me friggen forever to figure out vertical movement for some reason.

-I also really wanted the balloons to come from random starting points on the x axis every time it goes back down
to the bottom of the page, but I could only figure out how to make it change its x postion every time the sketch was
restarted.

-The stars in the background freakout when I click to see the confetti and never return to their
non-freaked out stage and I am not sure why.

-I also really wanted to have an array of balloon images looping so not only did the x position of the balloon
change everytime it reached the top of the screen, but also the position in the image array.

I think thats all I got for now.
